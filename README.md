# WDT App - Dashboard Management

This is a webapp that's created with the thought that a receptionist would use it to
check employee's and part-time delivery drivers work status. 

The app will generate 5 random fulltime employee's to a table and give you the ability to
check them in or out of office and set the estimated amount of time they will be out of office.
If they are out longer then estimated, then the app will create a toast notification with the
employee's name and tell you when they should have been back. 

The app also have some input fields where you can provide information about 
part-time delivery drivers. Here you can provide name, telephone, 
delivery address, estimated return time and what vehicle they are using. 
When you submit the data, it will populate the bottom table called "Delivery Board".
If a driver is not back at the estimated time, a toast will be triggered with the late 
drivers contact information. This table also has a "clear" button for you to delete drivers
as they finish their deliveries.
